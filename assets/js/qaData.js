    question: "Do socialists want my toothbruth?",
    answer: "No. Gross. This stems from a misconception around private property versus personal property. Socialists want to abolish private control over land and the means of producing goods and services (private property, privately held business) in favor of worker control (ranging from worker cooperatives to public ownership). You can have a phone, a toothbrush, and laugh in a socialist society.",

    question: "Big government sucks. Isn't socialism just more government?",
    answer: "Socialism seeks to further democracy in all our relationships: to government, to work, to the home. Government itself is a manifestation of the ruling class, as italian communist and prisoner Grasmci wrote. It can be radically democratic -or- a tool serving a ruling class (corporations, bureaucrats, wall street). Socialists believe in varying uses of the state: from anarchy to democratic confederations and syndicalism to using the state to protect gains that the working class have won in making work, government, and the home more egalitarian.",
